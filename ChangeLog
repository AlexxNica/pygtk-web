	Also make the RSS and news-related rules smarter.

	HTML and RSS, which causes us to actually validate at this point. Used
	James' suggestion to look at www.feedvalidator.org and hacked around
	the various peculiarities of RSS. The main change was moving the date
	format into a short tuple in newsitems.py (may it be the last time)
	and using format-specific setup_items functions. Hopefully this is
	good enough to go public.

	* head.src: add a link to the RSS output we now have.

	Bugzilla client written by jrb and alexl and announced at
	http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2003-September/msg00481.html
	(but I didn't add it because I didn't feel it's "released")

2004-03-14  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* applications.src: added Mum.

2004-03-12  Johan Dahlin  <johan@gnome.org>

	* developer.src: fix bonsai link to include gnome-python. Add a line
	about triage and testcases.

	* downloads.src: add win32 section.

	* Makefile: Added a "pages" target so you can invoke that without
	needing to pull and untarring the manuals while testing the site
	(since that tends to take some time).

2004-02-28  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

	* people.src: added a link and updated johan's entry. Reordered the
	entries alphabetically, changed the text slightly.

	* about.src: minor reorganization, added links and boldified bits of
	text.  Added  a paragraph on the Python language.

	understandable.

	up CVS information slightly.

	* feedback.src, head.src: rename Feedback to Support, and change
	header.  Did minor wording cleanups to the text; fixed a <div> placed
	too early.

	* developer.src: reformatted page; added text, convenient links and
	extra sections. This is just a first shot at where we might want to go
	with this.

	I ispelled and wrapped things a bit here and there while I was at it.

2004-02-27  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

	* articles/applets_arturogf/x304.html: fix link.

2004-02-25  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

	about it when I broke it apart!

	directory and add the first pygtk-web-hosted article, arturo's "Gnome

	* applications.src: Added CLAW, did spellcheck, 72-char wrap and cleanup.

	* default.css: minor style updates

	* index.src, head.src: move out duplicated code into head.src, which
	has the disadvantage of including the about text everywhere; the
	proper solution of course is for lgs to provide us with a proper
	template language :-)

	* index.src, news.src, newsitems.src: added a new newsitems template
	which holds news, so we don't duplicate it between the index and news
	pages.

	* foot.src: removed spurious line break

2004-01-22  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* default.css: update the width of h3, h4 and h5 since we don't have
	the about box in the welcome page anymore.

	* index.src: The index.src does not include head.src because the side
	bar is slightly different (it includes a small about box).

2003-01-19  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

	* applications.src: Added BloGTK.

2004-01-19  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	pygtk-web@pygtk.org.

2003-12-16  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* applications.src: added Meld

2003-12-15  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* img/appwindow.png, img/colorselector.png, messagedialog.png: Changed
	the old screenshots because they were taken with the spanish locale
	instead of the english one.
	
2003-12-13  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

	* Makefile: add commands to the extras target to pull the reference
	and tutorial tarballs from John's moeraki.com. Simplified some of the
	directory creation rules. The Makefile is rebuilding every file when
	one of them changes, which seems broken, but right now it does the
	job. 

	We can move to rsync when it's set up (it's better in dealing with
	tarball changes than a wget -c).

	* tutorial.src, reference.src: reordered tutorials and commented out
	lgs' version for now. Relinked tarballs from dist/.

2003-12-12  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* feedback.src: More information about how to fill a bug report.

	* people.src: Updated description for kiko.

	* applications.src: Added Red Carpet, Anaconda, Bugtool, Point2Play,
	Gnome Blog, Sketch and Wing IDE.

2003-12-12  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

	* Makefile: ensure that CSS and PNGs are copied over by using an
	extras .PHONY target. This could be nicer (since it will copy them
	every time we run make)..

2003-12-13  Jeff Waugh  <jdub@perkypants.org>

	* Makefile: WEBDIR ?= <default>, because we want to set it to something
	different when testing, and explicitly on the main server.

2003-12-11  John Finlay <finlay@moeraki.com>

	* reference.src, tutorial.src: Add files

	* articles.src: Change URL to PyGTK tutorials

	* head.src: Change URL to Pygtk tutorials and reference

	* Makefile: Change WEBDIR and PYTHON definitions. Add definitions for
	IMGDIR, TUTDIRS and REFDIRS. Add tutorial.src and reference.src to
	SRC_PAGES. Add CSS_FILES definition. Add rules for creating IMGDIR,
	TUTDIRS and REFDIRS. Add commands to copy image files and css files.
