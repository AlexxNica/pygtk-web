    * Makefile: ensure that CSS and PNGs are copied over by using an extras
    .PHONY target. This could be nicer (since it will copy them every time we
    run make)..

2003-12-13  Jeff Waugh  <jdub@perkypants.org>

	* Makefile: WEBDIR ?= <default>, because we want to set it to something
	different when testing, and explicitly on the main server.

	IMGDIR, TUTDIRS and REFDIRS. Add tutorial.src and reference.src to
