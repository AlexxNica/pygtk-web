2004-02-09  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

    * applications.src: Added CLAW, did spellcheck, 72-char wrap and cleanup.

    * default.css: minor style updates

    * index.src, head.src: move out duplicated code into head.src, which has
      the disadvantage of including the about text everywhere; the proper
      solution of course is for lgs to provide us with a proper template
      language :-)

    * index.src, news.src, newsitems.src: added a new newsitems template which
      holds news, so we don't duplicate it between the index and news pages.

    * foot.src: removed spurious line break

2004-01-22  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* default.css: update the width of h3, h4 and h5 since we don't have
	the about box in the welcome page anymore.

	* index.src: The index.src does not include head.src because the side
	bar is slightly different (it includes a small about box).

2003-01-19  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

    * applications.src: Added BloGTK.

2004-01-19  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* index.src: Added an about section in the welcome page.

	* default.css: Added specific styles for the mainText and about areas.
	Changed the background color of the menus to the one used in gnome.org.

	* applications.src: Added Revelation.

2004-01-09  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* Makefile: Added some boring logging output as jdub asked.

2004-01-04  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* applications.src: Added GnoCHM.

2004-01-03  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* applications.src: Added Narim and GDick. Changed the mail address
	for applying new application additions from lgs@cvs.gnome.org to
	pygtk-web@pygtk.org.

2003-12-23  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* feedback.src: added a small section about how to contact the web
	maintainers.

	* head.src (xml): changed the mail contact address to
	pygtk-web@pygtk.org.

2003-12-16  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* applications.src: added Meld

	* screenshots.src: removed the first screenshots because it actually
	shows a broken feature

2003-12-15  Johan Dahlin  <johan@gnome.org>

	* applications.src: added pyGestor

2003-12-13  Johan Dahlin  <johan@gnome.org>

	* people.src: Fix typo.

2003-12-15  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* applications.src: added matplotlib and a comment at the end of the
	page for submitting new apps.

2003-12-15  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* img/appwindow.png, img/colorselector.png, messagedialog.png: Changed
	the old screenshots because they were taken with the spanish locale
	instead of the english one.
	
2003-12-13  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

    * Makefile: add commands to the extras target to pull the reference and
    tutorial tarballs from John's moeraki.com. Simplified some of the
    directory creation rules. The Makefile is rebuilding every file when one
    of them changes, which seems broken, but right now it does the job. 

    We can move to rsync when it's set up (it's better in dealing with tarball
    changes than a wget -c).

    * tutorial.src, reference.src: reordered tutorials and commented out lgs'
    version for now. Relinked tarballs from dist/.

2003-12-12  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* feedback.src: More information about how to fill a bug report.

	* people.src: Updated description for kiko.

	* applications.src: Added Red Carpet, Anaconda, Bugtool, Point2Play,
	Gnome Blog, Sketch and Wing IDE.

2003-12-12  Christian Reis <kiko@async.com.br>

    * Makefile: ensure that CSS and PNGs are copied over by using an extras
    .PHONY target. This could be nicer (since it will copy them every time we
    run make)..

2003-12-13  Jeff Waugh  <jdub@perkypants.org>

	* Makefile: WEBDIR ?= <default>, because we want to set it to something
	different when testing, and explicitly on the main server.

2003-12-11  John Finlay <finlay@moeraki.com>

	* reference.src, tutorial.src: Add files

	* articles.src: Change URL to PyGTK tutorials

	* head.src: Change URL to Pygtk tutorials and reference

	* Makefile: Change WEBDIR and PYTHON definitions. Add definitions for
	IMGDIR, TUTDIRS and REFDIRS. Add tutorial.src and reference.src to
	SRC_PAGES. Add CSS_FILES definition. Add rules for creating IMGDIR,
	TUTDIRS and REFDIRS. Add commands to copy image files and css files.
