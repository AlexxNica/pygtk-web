    * Makefile: add commands to the extras target to pull the reference and
    tutorial tarballs from John's moeraki.com. Simplified some of the
    directory creation rules. The Makefile is rebuilding every file when one
    of them changes, which seems broken, but right now it does the job. 

    We can move to rsync when it's set up (it's better in dealing with tarball
    changes than a wget -c).

    * tutorial.src, reference.src: reordered tutorials and commented out lgs'
    version for now. Relinked tarballs from dist/.

2003-12-12  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@cvs.gnome.org>

	* feedback.src: More information about how to fill a bug report.

	* people.src: Updated description for kiko.

	* applications.src: Added Red Carpet, Anaconda, Bugtool, Point2Play,
	Gnome Blog, Sketch and Wing IDE.

    * Makefile: ensure that CSS and PNGs are copied over by using an extras
    .PHONY target. This could be nicer (since it will copy them every time we
    run make)..

2003-12-13  Jeff Waugh  <jdub@perkypants.org>

	* Makefile: WEBDIR ?= <default>, because we want to set it to something
	different when testing, and explicitly on the main server.

2003-12-11  John Finlay <finlay@moeraki.com>

	* reference.src, tutorial.src: Add files

	* articles.src: Change URL to PyGTK tutorials

	* head.src: Change URL to Pygtk tutorials and reference

	* Makefile: Change WEBDIR and PYTHON definitions. Add definitions for
	IMGDIR, TUTDIRS and REFDIRS. Add tutorial.src and reference.src to
	SRC_PAGES. Add CSS_FILES definition. Add rules for creating IMGDIR,
	TUTDIRS and REFDIRS. Add commands to copy image files and css files.
