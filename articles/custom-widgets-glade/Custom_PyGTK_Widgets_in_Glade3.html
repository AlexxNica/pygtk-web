        PyGTK Widgets in Glade3</a>
    </h3>
    <p class="date">21-3-2007, by <a href="http://unpythonic.blogspot.com">Ali Afshar</a></p>

    <div class="post-body">

      <p>Glade 3, GTK User Interface Designer is really quite nice since release
      3.1, since it does away with the gimp-like multi-window view and looks like a
      normal application. Another nice feature it has is being able to support
      widgets created in non-C (in our case PyGTK).</p>

      <p>Components of a plugin:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A catalog file</li>
        <li>A support module</li>
        <li>Some icon pixmaps (optional)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We shall use, for our example, the Kiwi Hyperlink widget, (which I wrote).
      This widget is an EventBox subclass, so we shall illustrate turning off some
      of the additional properties that are not required in the user interface
      designer.</p>

      <h3>The catalog file</h3>

      <p>This is described in <a
        href="http://developer.gnome.org/gladeui/3.6/catalogintro.html">http://developer.gnome.org/gladeui/3.6/catalogintro.html</a>
      and the subsequent pages of the documentation. Essentially there are two
      sections of the catalog:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The Widget definitions</li>
        <li>The Catalog list</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The Widget Definitions are like so:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;glade-widget-classes&gt;
        &lt;glade-widget-class title="Hyper Link" name="HyperLink"/&gt;
    &lt;/glade-widget-classes&gt;
    </pre>

      <p>These are the most-often used attributes for the widget class, but there
      are a few others too that are outlined on the documentation page.</p>

      <p>The catalog listing is much more basic, and less variable, and takes the
      following form:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;glade-widget-group name="KiwiWidgets" title="Kiwi Widgets"&gt;
        &lt;glade-widget-class-ref
            name="HyperLink"/&gt;
    </pre>

      <p>This lists all the widgets that are currently available. So far we have
      not strayed from the documentation, and this is exactly how you would add
      widgets that are non-PyGTK.</p>

      <p>What you have to do to make glade realise that you are using PyGTK widgets
      is use this in your main document element for the catalog:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;glade-catalog name="kiwiwidgets" library="kiwiwidgets" domain="glade-3" depends="gtk+" language="python"&gt;
    </pre>

      <p>The <tt>language="python"</tt> does that for you, and in addition the
      library attribute "kiwiwidgets" defines the location of our support library,
      which will be called kiwiwidgets.py.</p>

      <p>The catalog file should live with the other catalogs in the glade3 catalog
      directory, which is, on my system, at:</p>

    <pre>
    /usr/local/share/glade3/catalogs/kiwiwidgets.xml
    </pre>

      <p>You can turn various properties off from being displayed in the user
      interface designer using the &lt;properties&gt; tag in your widget-class tag.
      An example of this would be:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;property id="visible-window"
        visible="False" /&gt;

    &lt;property id="text"
        name="Text"
        translatable="True" /&gt;
    </pre>

      <p>Ok, so we showed you two properties here. The first is a property of Event
      Box which we don't want shown inside the UI Designer (users don't care), and
      that is achieved with a simple <tt>visible="False"</tt>. The second shows how
      to modify a property. We want the text of this hyperlink widget to be
      translatable, and access all the translation hooks in Glade with it.</p>

      <h3>The support module</h3>

      <p>The support module is python code that goes with our widgets. In our basic
      example, we have not defined anything fancy like a custom adaptor, or even a
      custom editor which we could if we were feeling brave, but will probably
      leave that for another blog posting.</p>

      <p>The support module should live in the glade module directory, and be named
      as defined in the catalog file. On my system this belongs here:</p>


      <pre>
      /usr/local/lib/glade3/modules/kiwiwidgets.py
      </pre>

      <p>the code of the module in this simple case contains only one thing, an
      import statement on the HyperLink class (since that is all that is needed to
      register it as a GObject Type.</p>

    <pre>
    from kiwi.ui.hyperlink import HyperLink
    </pre>

      <p>Glade3 takes care of the rest for us.</p>

      <p>That is all for now. Other items that should come up later include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Defining custom adaptors</li>
        <li>Defining custom widget editors</li>
        <li>Silencing glade queries for box subclasses</li>
        <li>Controlling the glade UI from Python</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And I shall address these if there is any interest.</p>

      <p style="font-weight:bold">NB: The API is early and changing at this stage, and there is no
      emphasis on backward-compatibility, so be prepared to throw any code away!</p>
