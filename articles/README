This directory holds source and HTML versions of articles related to
PyGTK.

- The directory name format is topic_mainauthornick, such as
  "sprockets_kiko" or "noogie_lgs".

- The subdirectory must contain at least an index.html file.

- If source is included and it is contained in a single file, it should
  be placed inside the subdirectory and named according to the directory
  format (using whichever extension reasonable). So, using the examples
  above, "sprockets_kiko/sprockets_kiko.xml" or "noogie_lgs/noogie_lgs.tex".

- If the source spans multiple files, use a src/ directory under the
  article subdirectory.
